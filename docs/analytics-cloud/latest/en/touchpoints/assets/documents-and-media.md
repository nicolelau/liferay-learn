# Documents and Media

Documents and Media files are assets you want site users to look at or download. Analytics Cloud provides insights on user engagement with your Documents and Media assets.

## Visitor Behavior

The Overview tab of an Asset's detail presents several data presentations. The first chart, called Visitor Behavior, contains four important metrics:

* Total Downloads
* Total Previews
* Total Comments
* Average Rating

### Downloads

The Downloads trend-line shows the total number of downloads per day (or hour, if Yesterday or Last 24 Hours are selected) over the selected time period.

### Previews

Documents and Media Documents can be previewed. Even if not ultimately downloaded, previewing shows interaction with the file and is therefore an important metric. The Previews trend line shows the total number of previews per day (or hour, if Yesterday or Last 24 Hours are selected) for the selected time period.

### Comments

Comments can be allowed on Documents and Media files. If enabled, the Comments trend line shows the total number of Comments on a file per day (or hour, if Yesterday or Last 24 Hours are selected) over the selected time period.

### Rating

Ratings can be enabled on Documents and Media. Whether the rating is a simple Thumb Up/Thumbs Down, or a Stars rating (0-5 Stars), the Rating in Analytics Cloud is a calculation that lets you compare how Users evaluate the Site's Documents and Media Files.

## Audience

The Audience report uses charts to present information about the audience interaction with the asset. It answers these questions:

* How many users are interacting with my content?
* Of these users, how many are known or anonymous?
* Of the known users who interacted with my content, how many belong to Analytics Cloud Segments?
* Of the users in Segments, what are the top 15 segments?

Here are the charts in the Audience report:

**Unique Visitors:** A donut chart that presents the percentage of total unique visitors who are known or anonymous. The center of the chart shows the total number of unique visitors. Tooltips on each chart section show the number of users for that section (e.g, the number of known or anonymous users).

**Known Individuals:** A donut chart that presents the percentage of known individuals who belong or do not belong to one or more Analytics Cloud Segment. The center of the chart shows the total number of known individuals. Tooltips on each chart section show the number of users for that section (e.g, the number of users belonging to one or more Segments). Click the chart title (Known Individuals) to view a list of all the known individuals who comprise the chart's data.

**Known Individuals Segments:** A bar chart that shows the percentage of known individuals that comprise each Segment. The chart shows a bar for each of the top five Segments, and then aggregates the remaining Segments into the last bar. A tooltip on the last bar shows the values for each of the remaining Segments.

Click Web Browser to see a donut chart displaying up to the top eight web browsers over the selected time period. If applicable, remaining web browsers are aggregated in the ninth donut segment.

## Asset Appears On

The Asset Appears On table includes a Page Name and URL. Like any Page data in Analytics Cloud, only Pages that were interacted with in some way by site visitors are tracked and reported. It's important to note that the link doesn't take you to the actual Page with the Asset on it. Instead, it leads to the Page Analytics view of the Page. From there you can click the URL to the actual Page.
