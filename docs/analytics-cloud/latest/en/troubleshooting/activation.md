# Activation

There are a few steps that must be performed in order to begin using Analytics Cloud. If these steps have not yet been performed, you may encounter an error during the activation process. Below, we've listed the most common causes of errors during activation and their related resolutions.

## "Someone has already claimed the offering"

This error can occur if someone from your organization has already set up Analytics Cloud and has the role of Owner. If you see this error, please contact the user in your organization that has set up the Workspace and request access from them.

If you are unable to determine who in your organization has set up the Analytics Cloud Workspace, please contact us at <analytics-cloud@liferay.com>. We'll be happy to assist you with identifying the Owner so that you can request access.

## You Have Not Yet Created a Liferay Account

In this case, simply create a Liferay account(the option will appear in when attempting to sign in). Once you've created an account, the account can be associated to your organization's Analytics Cloud subscription or Basic Tier. Please contact us at <analytics-cloud@liferay.com> so that we can set it up for you.

## Unable to Access the Analytics Cloud Basic Tier

The Basic tier of Analytics Cloud is associated with a Liferay DXP subscription. If your organization has a DXP subscription, we can associate your account with that subscription so that you can claim the Basic tier Workspace. Please contact us at <analytics-cloud@liferay.com> and we will set it up.
