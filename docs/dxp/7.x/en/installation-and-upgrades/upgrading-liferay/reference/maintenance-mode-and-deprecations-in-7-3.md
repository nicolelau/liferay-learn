# Maintenance Mode and Deprecations in 7.3

In some new Liferay versions, Liferay stops enhancing specific items or makes plans to remove specific apps and capabilities.

1. **Moving an Item to Maintenance Mode:** Support continues for the item but enhancements cease. Future deprecation is not necessarily implied.

2. **Deprecation:** Support for a feature may stop in the next minor release or later. In that future release, Liferay removes the feature from the Liferay bundle. The removed feature may published as a [Marketplace app](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) or its source code may be preserved as an archive. Liferay puts many archives in the `modules/apps/archived` source code folder. During deprecation, the feature may be disabled.

```important::
   Please see the `maintenance mode and deprecation policies <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015767952-Maintenance-Mode-and-Deprecation>`_ for details.
```

```note::
   Plan to stop using deprecated apps/capabilities because they are not being developed and will be removed.
```

## Items Moved to Maintenance Mode

* Export/Import
* Site Templates
* Liferay Reports
