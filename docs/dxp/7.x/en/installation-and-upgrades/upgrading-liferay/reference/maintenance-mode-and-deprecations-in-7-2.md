# Maintenance Mode and Deprecations in 7.2

With each new DXP release, a feature may not warrant continued enhancements or may become obsolete. Stopping enhancements for a feature puts it in *Maintenance Mode*.

**Maintenance Mode:** The feature is supported but no longer being enhanced.

Obsolete features are eventually either removed or replaced with newer, better features. Before dropping support for an obsolete feature, Liferay marks it *Deprecated*.

**Deprecated:** The feature will be unsupported as early as the next minor version release. For example, support for a feature deprecated in 7.2 can be dropped as early as 7.3.

```important::
   Plan to stop using deprecated features because their support may cease as early as the next minor release.
```

```important::
   Please see the `maintenance mode and deprecation policies <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015767952-Maintenance-Mode-and-Deprecation>`_ for details.
```

## Deprecated Feature Availability

Deprecated features have different availability:

**Bundled:** The feature is included in the Liferay product.

**Marketplace:** The feature is included in a Marketplace app final version.

**Archived:** The feature is unavailable, but its code is available.

**Removed:** The feature and its code are unavailable.
