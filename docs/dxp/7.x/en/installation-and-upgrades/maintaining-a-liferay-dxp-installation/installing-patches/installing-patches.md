# Installing Patches

While we strive for perfection with every DXP release, the reality of the human condition dictates that releases may not be as perfect as originally intended. But we've planned for that by providing patches for DXP subscribers and a Patching Tool for installing them.

## Overview

- [Patch Types](./02-patch-types.md): All patches fix bugs, and some patches focus on security. While Liferay makes patches available to all subscribers regularly, the Liferay support team works with customers to provide quick fixes for particular urgent situations too. It's important to familiarize yourself with all of the patch types so you can keep DXP installations running well.

- [The Patching Process](./03-the-patching-process.md): Provides a workflow for patching a DXP installation.

- [Patching a DXP WAR](./04-patching-a-dxp-war.md): Demonstrates patching a DXP WAR file on your existing application server.

- [Installing the Patching Tool](./05-installing-the-patching-tool.md): Install the Patching Tool and update it following these instructions.

- [Configuring the Patching Tool](./06-configuring-the-patching-tool.md): Explains how to configure the Patching Tool with DXP runtime environments.

- [Working with Patches](./07-working-with-patches.md): Demonstrates how to manage patches, starting with listing your DXP version, installed patches, and locally available patches. It goes on to cover uninstalling patches, patch cleanup, and handling collisions between patches and deployed plugins.

- [Keeping Up With Fix Packs and Service Packs](./08-keeping-up-with-fix-packs.md): Stay updated with the latest patches, products, and information for maintaining DXP installations.

- [Updating DXP CE](./09-updating-dxp-ce.md): Get fixes by using the latest DXP CE GA release with your existing DXP database.
