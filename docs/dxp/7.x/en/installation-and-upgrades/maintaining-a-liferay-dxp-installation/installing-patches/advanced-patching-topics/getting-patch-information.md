The Patching Tool's support-info command gathers details that help Liferay Support understand your environment fast.

## Including support-info in Support Tickets

Providing your environment's information (e.g., hardware architecture) and patch level to Liferay Support is critical for reproducing your issues. Write your support information (including your patch level) to a file by executing this command: 

```bash
./patching-tool.sh support-info
```

The support information is written to file `patching-tool-support-info-actual-timestamp.txt` in your `patching-tool` folder. Please upload this file to the [Help Center](https://help.liferay.com/hc) ticket.
