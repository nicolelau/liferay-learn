# Patch Installation Overview

While we strive for perfection with every DXP release, the reality of the human condition dictates that releases may not be as perfect as originally intended. But we've planned for that by providing enterprise subscribers DXP patches and a Patching Tool for installing them. The articles that follow cover the patching topics.

## Patch Types

Liferay provides patches for various situations. Security patches are created fast for security issues as soon as possible. The latest fixes are also incorporated in fix packs, which are made available regularly. And you can always request a hotfix for urgent situations. It's important to familiarize yourself with all of the patch types so you can keep your DXP installations running well. See [Patch Types](./patch-types.md) to learn more.

## The Patching Process

Before applying patches, it's helpful to understand the typical workflow. Follow our [process](./the-patching-process.md) for patching DXP safely and comprehensively.

## Patching a DXP WAR 

If you're running DXP as a WAR file on an existing application server, there are additional steps for patching DXP. [Patching a DXP WAR](./patching-a-dxp-war.md) explains guides you through each step and command.

## Installing the Patching Tool 

The patching process and the Patching Tool are always improving. When you try to install a patch that requires the latest Patching Tool, the patch tells you the Patching Tool version needed. The latest Patching Tool version is available on the Customer Portal and easy to install. See [Installing the Patching Tool](./installing-the-patching-tool.md) to install the latest tool fast. 

## Configuring the Patching Tool

DXP installation environments vary by app server and by company requirements. Properties files and commands facilitate configuring the tool for your needs. [Configuring the Patching Tool](./configuring-the-patching-tool.md) demonstrates setting up the tool to fit various environments.

## Working with Patches

As you maintain DXP, it's important to know your installation's current patch level and to know details about new patches. In [Working with Patches](./working-with-patches.md) you'll explore listing patch information, uninstalling patches, patch cleanup, and handling collisions between patches and custom plugins.

## Keeping Up With Patches

[Keeping Up With Fix Packs and Service Packs](./keeping-up-with-fix-packs.md) explains how to stay updated with the latest patches, products, and information for maintaining DXP installations.

## Updating DXP CE

[Updating DXP CE](./updating-dxp-ce.md) Demonstrates updating DXP CE with the latest fixes by using the latest DXP CE GA release with your DXP CE database, file store, and search engine.
