# Running Theme Tasks

[Liferay JS Theme Toolkit](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-themes-sdk/tree/master/packages)-based themes, such as those created with the [Liferay Theme Generator](../../../../../developing-applications/tooling/other-tools/theme-generator.md), have theme tasks you can use. You can access them from the `scripts` section of your Theme's `package.json` using the pattern below:

```bash
npm run [command]
```

You can use the available Theme tasks to

* [Build themes](./building-themes.md)
* [Deploy themes](./deploying-themes.md)
* [Change your Theme's base Theme](./changing-the-base-theme)
* Extend your Theme with Themelets
* [Configure your Theme's app server](./configuring-your-themes-app-server)
* [Preview theme changes](./previewing-theme-changes.md)
* [Copy an existing theme's files](./copying-an-existing-themes-files.md)
* [List your theme's extensions](./listing-your-themes-extensions.md)

You can also [overwrite and extend these Theme tasks](../../../extending-themes/overwriting-and-extending-liferay-theme-tasks.md) to customize what they do
