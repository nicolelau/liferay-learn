> **Note:** To start Liferay DXP instance fast for touring or demonstration purposes, see [Getting Started with Liferay DXP](../../getting-started/starting-with-the-dxp-docker-image.md)

## Prerequisites

**Java JDK 8 or 11** (see [www.java.com](https://www.java.com/)) are required. 

## Downloading DXP

Download DXP for the installation you want:

* **Tomcat bundle:** The Apache Tomcat application server with Liferay DXP pre-deployed. It's the simplest and fastest way to get started with Liferay DXP on-premise.

* **Already using an application server?** The DXP `.war` file and dependencies are available for installing DXP on existing application servers.

[Download DXP](./03-downloading-liferay-dxp.md) to get it either way.

## Connecting a Database

Database options:

* A full-featured, supported RDBMS is required for using DXP beyond basic exploration. See [Connecting a Database](./04-connecting-a-database.md).

* HSQL database (included for demonstration purposes only).

## Running DXP

Execute DXP's startup script to [run DXP](./05-running-liferay-dxp-for-the-first-time.md).

Then use the [Setup Wizard](./06-using-the-setup-wizard.md) to complete basic configuration.

> **Note:** If you have a Liferay DXP Enterprise subscription, [activate Liferay DXP](./08-activating-liferay-dxp.md) to use all that the subscription offers.
